"""
This module contains methods for filtering a list of Molecules representing a single Species,
keeping only the representative structures. Relevant for filtration of negligible mesomerism contributing structures.

The rules this module follows are (by order of importance):
1. Minimum overall deviation from the Octet Rule (elaborated for Dectet and Duodectet for hypervalance heteroatoms)
2. Additional charge separation is only important for radicals and if it makes a new radical site in the species
3. If a structure must have charge separation, negative charges will be assigned to more electronegative atoms, whereas
   positive charges will be assigned to less electronegative atoms
4. Opposite charges will be as close as possible to one another, and vice versa

    If the species is a radical, we first check whether keeping an extra charge span separation might be important for
    reactivity by relocating the radical site. If so, wee keep these structures.
    For example:
    - Both of NO2's resonance structures will be kept: [O]N=O <=> O=[N+.][O-]
    - NCO will only have two resonance structures [N.]=C=O <=> N#C[O.], and will loose the third structure which has
      the same octet deviation, has a charge separation, but the radical site has already been considered: [N+.]#C[O-]
    - CH2NO keeps all three structures, since a new radical site is introduced: [CH2.]N=O <=> C=N[O.] <=> C=[N+.][O-]
    However, if the species is not a radical we only keep the structures with the minimal charge span.
    For example:
    - NSH will only keep N#S and not [N-]=[SH+]
    - The following species will loose two thirds of its resonance structures, which are charged: CS(=O)SC <=>
      CS(=O)#SC <=> C[S+]([O-]SC <=> CS([O-])=[S+]C <=> C[S+]([O-])#SC <=> C[S+](=O)=[S-]C
    - The azide structure is know to have three resonance structures: [NH-][N+]#N <=> N=[N+]=[N-] <=> [NH+]#[N+][N-2];
      here we'll lose the third one, which is theoretically "true", but doesn't contribute to reactivity.
